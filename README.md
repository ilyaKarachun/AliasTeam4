## Overview

This document outlines the Alias game, a multiplayer game built with Node.js. It includes chat functionality and a feature to check for similar words.

## Game Description

Alias is a word-guessing game where players form teams. Each team takes turns where one member describes a word and others guess it. The game includes a chat for players to communicate and a system to check for similar words.

### Objective

Teams try to guess as many words as possible from their teammates' descriptions.

### Turns

Each turn is timed. Describers cannot use the word or its derivatives.

### Scoring

Points are awarded for each correct guess. Similar words are checked for validation.

### End Game

The game concludes after a predetermined number of rounds, with the highest-scoring team winning.

## System Requirements

- **Backend**: Node.js
- **Database**: CouchDB
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Docker**

## User Authorization

User authorization in this system is facilitated through the use of JSON Web Tokens (JWT). Upon successful authentication with the provided user credentials, a JWT is generated using a secure secret key. This token serves as a digital credential that encapsulates user identity information and is used for subsequent authorization.

### JWT Generation

The JWT is generated by encoding user-specific data and signing it with a secret key. The encoded information typically includes user identifiers, roles, or any other necessary data for authentication purposes. This process ensures the integrity and authenticity of the token.

### Token Expiration

To enhance security, each JWT has an expiration time of 2 hours. This means that after this period, the token will no longer be valid, and users will need to re-authenticate to obtain a new token.

### Session Validation

Throughout the user's active session, each HTTP request to the server includes the JWT in the request headers. The server then validates the token to ensure its authenticity and checks if it has expired. If the token is valid and within its expiration period, the request is processed; otherwise, the server responds with an authorization error.

This approach provides a secure and efficient means of managing user sessions, enhancing the overall security of the authentication process.

**Note:** It's crucial to keep the secret key used for JWT signing secure, as it plays a vital role in maintaining the integrity of the tokens.
